It is certainly true that environmental problems should be taken seriously in order to prevent disaster in the future. Unfortunately, however, most people do not take this threat seriously enough and this is for a number of reasons. The following essay will outline why the majority of people do not care enough about the environment.

Perhaps the main reason people do not give the environment much thought is because at the moment it does not affect their daily life. This is because, generally, they cannot see how global warming or pollution is destroying the environment. It is only when a crisis occurs, such as flooding, that people start to consider the reasons behind it. However, these are soon forgotten and the situation is once again ignored.

Another reason environmental issues are ignored is that people do not know enough about them. Although it is generally understood that recycling helps to save resources, this is perhaps the only step people take to help the situation. Most people have heard of global warming and pollution, but do not fully understand the implications of them. If they did, sure they would use their car less and try at all costs to save resources more.

Many people also believe that these environmental problems will not impact society for another 50 to 100 years. Consequently, people feel these problems can be dealt with then by future generations.

Overall, therefore, whilst there may be some people who are fully aware of the environmental problems facing the planet, the majority of the population still do not give them the attention they deserve.

There have been huge advances in technology and industries in the past 3 decades. This has had an adverse impact on the environment. There is a common belief that some people are ignorant to the world environment issues. However, I believe that there is a lot of awareness about the environmental problems and there is considerable effort put to bring in sustainable practices to reduce this impact.

The advance in technology has accelerated industrial manufacturing processes. There are more goods produced per day than ever before. Most industrialists and politicians are striving hard to push these boundaries to maximise profits irrespective of the pressure that’s being put on the environment. This has led to a common belief among most people that the climate change is happening due to the ignorance and insensitivity of people to the environmental issues. For example, it is due to the high demand of whale meat that whale hunting is practiced to the point where most whales are now endangered species. The demand comes from people and industrialists and governments are just leveraging this demand to their own advantage to make profits.

However, in the past ten years, there have been many nonprofit organisations that are fighting to conserve the endangered species and demanding strict actions for any violation in this regard. Governments have now become supportive to this cause. Many people are choosing to go vegetarian and vegan. Organisations have developed frameworks to implement and adhere to sustainable practices such as reducing emissions, recycling waste etc. Most countries have pledged to switch to renewable energy.

To conclude, while there was severe pressure on environment resources for a long while, there has been a major shift in people’s attitude towards the world environment problems. As more awareness is being created, there has been little resistance among people and government to make changes in their lifestyle to address these environmental issues.
